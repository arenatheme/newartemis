## Before you customize your theme

Before you customize your theme, it's a good idea to do the following tasks:

* [Duplicate your theme](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/managing-themes/duplicating-themes)  
  to create a backup copy. This makes it easy to discard your changes and start again if you need to.

## Edit your theme settings

### Steps

* From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store** &gt; **Themes**.
* Find the theme that you want to edit and click **Customize**.

Different types of pages have different **theme sections**. When you first open the theme editor, the settings for the home page are shown. To access the settings for other pages, select the page type from the top bar drop-down menu:

The theme editor toolbar is divided into Sections and Theme settings.

You can use sections to modify the content and layout of the different pages on your store. You can use theme settings to customize your store's fonts and colors, and make changes to your social media links and checkout settings.

### Sections

Sections are customizable blocks of content that determine the layout of your online store. Each theme includes static sections and dynamic sections.

#### Static sections

**Eg: Header & Footer Section **

Static sections are always in specific locations on your online store. You can [edit static sections](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings#edit-static-sections), but you can't rearrange or remove them. Each type of page on your online store includes different static sections.

#### Dynamic sections {#dynamic-sections}

You can [add](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings#add-dynamic-sections), [rearrange](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings#rearrange-dynamic-sections), and [remove](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings#remove-dynamic-sections) dynamic sections to customize the layout of your home page. Each theme has a unique set of dynamic sections to choose from.
